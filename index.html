                creative
                direction, design, copywriting, system design, and even the front-end and WordPress build.</p>

                <p>A web developer's job is to create websites. While their primary role is to ensure the website is
                    visually appealing and easy to navigate, many web developers are also responsible for the website's
                    performance and capacity.</p>

                <p>A Junior Web Developer works with a team of developers to create new websites and applications. The
                    “junior” designation means you work under the supervision of senior developers in your department,
                    but
                    you may be involved in all stages of the project, from brainstorming to final testing.</p>
